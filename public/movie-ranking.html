<h1>The Best Movies According to Brylle</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
  Forrest Gump may be an overly sentimental film with a somewhat problematic
  message, but its sweetness and charm are usually enough to approximate true
  depth and grace.
</p>

<h3>Cast Away</h3>
<p>
  Flawed but fascinating, Cast Away offers an intelligent script, some of Robert
  Zemeckis' most mature directing, and a showcase performance from Tom Hanks.
</p>

<h3>The Terminal</h3>
<p>
  The Terminal transcends its flaws through the sheer virtue of its
  crowd-pleasing message and a typically solid star turn from Tom Hanks.
